# Continuous Delivery Pipeline:

## Azure YAML Pipeline:
This YAML pipeline will be stored in the source control repository.

## Build Stage:
### Tasks:
- Check out the source code from the repository.
- Build the .NET application.
- Build the Docker image.

## Test Deployment:
### Pre-Deployment Validation:
- Run any necessary tests to ensure the application is functioning correctly.
### Deployment:
- Deploy the Docker container to the test environment in Azure.

## Production Deployment:
### Pre-Deployment Validation:
- Ensure that the application has passed all necessary tests and security checks.
### Deployment:
- Deploy the Docker container to the production environment in Azure.

## Security Best Practices:
### Container Security:
- Use Azure Container Registry for storing Docker images securely.
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to control access to Azure resources.
- Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using Azure Security Center.
### Application Security:
- Implement secure coding practices.
- Use Azure Key Vault for storing sensitive information such as connection strings and secrets.
- Implement Azure Application Gateway or Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) for protection against common web vulnerabilities.

## Additional Considerations If More Time Were Available:
- Implementing automated tests for the .NET application.
- Implementing blue-green deployment or canary deployment strategies for safer production deployments.
- Implementing infrastructure as code using Terraform to provision Azure resources.

This pipeline will automate the build and deployment process for the .NET application, ensuring that it is deployed consistently and securely across different environments.
